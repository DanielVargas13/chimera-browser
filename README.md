## How to build
0. Listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDpmVUEjagg) in the background (always do this when building or compiling)
1. [Download and install NodeJS onto your computer's disk](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Open the repository folder into your OS's terminal (usually via the `cd` command)
3. Run the command `npm i` or `npm install` to make sure you've downloaded all the dependencies
4. Run with `npm start` to make sure it works correctly on your OS (has been tested only on Windows 10 x64)
5. Build it into an executable file by running `npm run buildwin` or `npm run buildlinux` depending on your operating system (but I sincerely hope you've figured that out by now)
6. Pray to whatever god you worship that it compiles.
