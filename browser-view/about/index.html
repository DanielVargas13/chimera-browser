            made with &lt;3 by statera from wayoutware. <br> <br>
            i would like to thank my supportive boyfriend, without whom
            i probably would not have had the self confidence to publish again.<br><br>
            i would also like to take the time to show love to my wonderful dog of 10 years,
            who went blind from diabetes complications.<br><br>
            lastly, i would not like to thank the institution in which i am shackled daily.
            let your passions roam free, user. thank you for using my software.
