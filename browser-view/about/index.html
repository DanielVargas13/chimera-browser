            <h2> what is chimera? </h2><hr>
            chimera started as a pet project from my dissatisfaction with the general lack of
            slick looking user interfaces in current browers. it's like a hypothetical offspring
            of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge... but open source.
            <br><br>
            <h2> extensions </h2><hr>
            extensions can be installed in "C:\chimera\extensions" on windows or
            "/usr/share/chimera-extensions" on linux. they'll have full access to
            your browser so only install extensions from reliable sources, as you would
            when installing programs.

            i would like to thank my supportive boyfriend, without whom
            i probably would not have had the self confidence to publish again.<br><br>
            i would also like to take the time to show love to my wonderful dog of 10 years,
            who went blind from diabetes complications.<br><br>
            let your passions roam free, user. thank you for using my software.
